# Continuous PSRL using GPs

## Infrastructure notes

Things we would like to add to the codebase:
* Functionality for testing models on randomly sampled ground truth data.
* Plotting rewards (and trajectories of simple environments).
* Agent snapshot saving and loading.
* Tests for the GP models (VFEGP and VFEGPStack).
* Finish agent implementation.
